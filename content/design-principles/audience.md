## Audience

 Consider your audience when you're creating data visualization.

##### Key questions
* Who is your audience?
* What is their familiarity with data visualization?
* How much information do they need?


<h3 id="general-users">If your user group is general (i.e. the American
 public)</h3>
 For the general public, stick with basic and most common chart types that
 people can easily understand. Adding emphasis and labels will help highlight
 the point of the visual and tell the story of the information. Consider using
 multiple simple charts to step the user through the data, rather than one big
 complex visualization.

 <h3 id="specific-users">If your user is refined to a specific audience</h3>
 When youâ€™re creating visualizations for a specific target, take into
 consideration their familiarity with the data, visualization types, and the
 terminology used to label and describe data. More complex stories might
 necessitate more complex visuals, however, this does not mean it should lack
 emphasis.
