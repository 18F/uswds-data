## Color

When used properly, color can help clarify relationships between data, provide
emphasis for certain data points, and maintain a consistent brand voice. When
used poorly, color can overwhelm the user, make the data confusing and break
with brand standards to appear inconsistent.

##### Key questions
* Does the use of color have a purpose?
* Have you relied on more than just color to connote meaning?
* Have you accounted for color blindness?

### Color schemes

The following sets of colors maintain CFPB brand cohesion and create accessible
graphics.

#### Subsets and relationships
To highlight part of a set of data, or show that things are related, use a tint
or a shade of the main color.

#### Categorical
Use categorical color schemes when you're visualizing groups of things. These
are discrete colors that do not imply an visual relationship between the sets
of data.


#### Sequential

When you're displaying sequential data that shows a range of data in a ranked
order, use these sequential colors to imply the relationship.

### Color accessibility
Color should never be solely relied on to convey meaning in a visualization
because of accessibility standards for people who are blind and visually
impaired. There should be other clues beyond color to convey meaning or
relationship; this is a key reason that also directly labeling data and using
patterns is important.

You can use the [Color Palette Accessibility
Checker](https://accessibility.oit.ncsu.edu/tools/color-contrast/accessible-color-palette.php?&colors=1e9642,20aa3f,66c368,addc91,c7e5b3,e2efd8,005e5d,257675,579695,89b6b5,b4d2d1,d4e7e6,0050b4,0072ce,4497dc,7eb7e8,afd2f2,d6e8fa,002d72,254b87,5674a3,889cc0,b3c0d9,d3daeb,a01b68,b4267a,c55998,d486b2,e3b2cc,f0d8e2,b63014,d14124,dd735d,e79e8e,f0c3b8,f7e0d9,dc731c,ff9e1b,ffb858,ffce8d,ffe1b9,fff0dd,745745,8a6c57,a18573,baa496,d3c5bc,e7ddd7,101820,43484e,5a5d61,75787b,919395,b4b5b6,d2d3d5,e7e8e9,f7f8f9,ffffff&main=ffffff&level=AA) to check and confirm the
accessibility of CFPB colors at different type sizes.

### Color blindness
When choosing colors for a graph, keep in mind that they may look different to
people with color blindness. [About 1 in 12 men with Northern European ancestry
have green/red color
blindness](https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about).

Instead of green/red, the teal/red color combination should used instead for
pro/con, yes/no, positive/negative relationships. This both improves
accessibility associated with color blindness, and also leaves the CFPB green
color to represent the brand.
