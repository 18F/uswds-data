## Why it matters
Data is often represented on websites, in reports and other documents. When done well data provide the reader with a foundation through which they can begin to quantify their own understanding of particular issues or findings. When done poorly, data can be misrepresented to lead the reader to incorrect conclusions. These guidelines will help you represent data clearly and in ways that will lead to better understanding.

## Guidelines
### Mobile first.
And by extension, web first.  Designing for print can introduce complexities we don’t want to address here, so we’re focusing first on designing data visualizations with the smaller screen in mind.  
### Less is more.  
Let your data tell the story and do the work for you.  Lower the cognitive load by removing unnecessary visual components. If it isn’t necessary, get rid of it.  This applies to drop shadows, boxes around visualizations or parts of visualizations.   A simple visual scan should be sufficient for many data visualizations.   

When referring to specific data points, use data in the simplest, most meaningful manner possible. When describing data or elements of data visualizations, follow standard practice. Describe data succinctly. Do not embellish with jargon-filled language or statements that an average reader won't understand. It is your job to describe your data correctly, not the reader's job to guess what you mean.
## Style counts. 

Select a complementary way to visualize the data. Your reader should be able to interpret the data correctly with a minimal amount of supporting information.  A useful technique is to ask a reader to interpret your visualization without an explanation. If a reader has to take an inordinate amount of time to interpret the data, or cannot correctly interpret the data without help, the visualization isn't effective.  
Establish and follow a style guide.  If you don’t have one yet, use the US Web Design Standards. Keep the use of styles, typography and colors uniform.  Use standard, legible typography, elements, and colors.  If iconography is used, keep it uniform (a zoom button on a map - for example, should always look the same).  Be careful when using color - gradients in a bar chart can lead to the wrong interpretation. 
## Cite the data. 
Citations are important. Include a link to machine-readable source data where possible.  Do not link to PDFs where possible - PDFs are generally a very inefficient way of sharing information and add burden on the reader. 
## Be a trusted source. 
Let the data tell the story - but only the one it can support.  Avoid misleading your reader by using inconsistent colors, incorrect axis, misleading titles, suggestive correlations or other manipulations that aren’t substantiated by the data.  Doing so will alienate attentive readers, and lead to broader distrust of government data sources.  

In the next sections we’ll discuss some common types of visualizations, and some guidelines on how to use them. We're going to talk about five common ways to represent data: tables, bar charts, line charts, area charts, and maps.
