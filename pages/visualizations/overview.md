Drawing clear explanations from complex data is not easy. People should be able to interpret the data correctly with a minimal amount of supporting information. Selecting the right visualization for your data helps.

In this guide we've identified some of the more common methods used to visualize data, and have compiled some recommendations to help you select the right visualization type for you.
