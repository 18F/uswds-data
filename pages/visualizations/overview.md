Understanding data is crucial to public education, debate, and decision-making. Done well, data visualizations help people more precisely understand the issues that matter to them. They are not only informative but also beautiful. Done poorly, data visualizations misrepresent research findings and lead people to incorrect conclusions. Moving from basic principles to best practices, this brief guide to visualizing United States Census data introduces the art and and science of drawing clear explanations from complex data.  

In this guide we've identified some of the more common methods used to visualize data, and have compiled some recommendations to help you select the right visualization type for you.
