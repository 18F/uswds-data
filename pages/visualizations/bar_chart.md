## When to use it
Use bar charts to compare values grouped into separate categories. Use bar charts to show time series data only if the data points are all at equal intervals. If the length of time between measurements is not the same for every data point and your variable is one that changes continously over time (such as employment rate or revenue) use a [line chart](link).


Your raw data might look something like this:

| State                                                  | Unemployment rate in 1980 | Unemployment rate in 1990    |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Number of Employees                                    |                           |                              |
| Revenue (Total $'s)                                    |                           |                              |
| Percent (%) of Revenue from SBIR's (from all agencies) |                           |                              |


## The basics
- Maintain space between bars so theyâ€™re easy to tell apart.
- Use a single color to represent all data representing the same measurement.
- Start numeric axis at zero where possible.
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language.
- Maintain consistency and dimensions in look and feel when representing multiple, similar bar charts on a page.
- Avoid visual elements like bar outlines, extra grid lines, borders and graphics.

## Examples

A bar charts can also use  data representing the same measurement for two different years.


Bar charts can show negative values.

The order in which you put your items tells people how to interpret them. Put the shortest bar first to highlight the lowest values. To highlight the highest values, put the longest bar first. 


## Things to avoid
- Too many bars on the same chart.
- Alphabetical sorting of values.
- Representing the same measurement with different colors, or gradients.
- Starting a numeric axis at anything but zero in an attempt to highlight the difference in values.
- Not including enough information
