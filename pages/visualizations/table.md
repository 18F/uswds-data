## When to use it
Tables can be designed to not only share raw data, but to tell a story about it.  Organized in rows and columns, tables can be organized to compare real values between different variables. 

Tables are generally suitable only for data: two or more “objects” (rows) that share two or more “values” (columns). In tables, column widths are the same for all rows, which can make them easier to scan visually. Tables are easily navigable for sightless users so long as the content is organized in a logical way. Here are some other guidelines to consider:

Your raw data might look like this:

## The basics
- Use column labels that clearly identify what the data represent.  Avoid using internal abbreviations that won't be understandable to your reader, or system-generated labels that aren't intelligible.
- Text values within cells should be left-aligned, and numeric values right-aligned.  
- Use of decimals or symbols within your data should be consistent.  Truncating data should be avoided. 
- Sorting of values - for example highest to lowest value - should be clearly indicated in the table. 

## Examples

## Things to avoid
- Where possible, avoid the use of heavy table borders, row shading or other visual elements that don't add value to the interpretation of the data.  
- Fonts should be chosen for legibility and uniformness for representing data - avoid the use of fonts better suited for text, or special fonts.
