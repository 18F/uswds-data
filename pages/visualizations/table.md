## When to use them
Tables present data in the form of two or more “objects,” or rows, that share two or more “values," or columns. The rows and columns of tables give direct access to the real values of different variables. Tables can tell a story as well as show the raw data.

Tables are one of the simplest ways to share even very large data sets. People using screen readers can access tables as long as their contents are organized logically. However, large tables are hard to skim quickly, which is one reason why charts and graphs are so popular.

## The basics
- Labels should clearly describe what columns mean. Rewrite labels that use abbreviations or overly technical words.
- Left-align text values within cells. Right-align numeric values.   
- Keep the presentation of decimals or symbols consistent.  
- Try not to shorten or cut off data.
- Use the title or caption to explain if you are deliberately ordering values.
- Choose fonts that make it easy to tell numbers apart, even at small sizes.

## Things to avoid
- Heavy table borders, row shading or other distracting visual elements
