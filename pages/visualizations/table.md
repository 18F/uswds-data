## When to use it
Tables present data in the form of two or more “objects,” or rows, that share two or more “values," or columns. The rows and columns of tables give direct access to the real values of different variables. Tables can tell a story as well as show the raw data.

Tables are one of the simplest ways to share even very large data sets. People using screen readers can access tables as long as their contents are organized logically. However, large tables are hard to skim quickly, which is one reason why charts and graphs are so popular. 

=======

## The basics
- Labels should clearly describe what columns mean. For non-experts, rewrite system-generated labels that use abbreviations or overly technical words.
- Left-align text values within cells. Right-align numeric values.   
- Keep the presentation of decimals or symbols consistent. 
- Try not to shorten or cut off data. 
- Make it clear if you are deliberately ordering values, for example from highest to lowest.
- Choose fonts that make it easy to tell apart numbers at small sizes. 

## Examples

## Things to avoid
- Heavy table borders, row shading or other visual elements that don't help people interpret the data 
- Fonts better suited for headlines or decoration.
