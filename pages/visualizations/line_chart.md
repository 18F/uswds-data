## What
On a line chart, the upward or downward slope of the line shows how the value of an item changes, usually over time.


## Why
A continuous line calls attention to overall trends rather than individual data points. Never use a line chart to compare non-numeric variables, such as country of birth. To compare data in separate categories, use a [bar chart](linked). 


Your raw data might look something like this:

| State   | Unemployment rate in 1980 | Unemployment rate in 1990    | Unemployment rate in 2000    |
|---------|---------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Nevada  |         0.00%             |         0.00%                |         0.00%                | 

## The basics
- Make sure the lines look very different from each other, either in color or pattern.
- Label each line directly if possible. Avoid keys or legends. 
- Start the numeric axis at zero where possible. 
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language. 
- To highlight small changes over time, you may start the y-axis at a non-zero value.  Just make sure to clearly show a clear break between zero and the first number (see example below). 

## Examples

Use a focused-in chart to make small but important changes easier to see. Put the focused chart next to a main chart that shows the trend in full context. 

Put circles or dots on the line at each data point when the lengths of time between each data point is not the same.

Comparing trends is easier when lines are not layered on top of each other. Give each line its own small chart if there are more than five lines.

You can create a single card with both a line and a bar chart as long as both charts use the same units of time. 

## Things to avoid

- Placing labels too far away from their respective lines.
- Unnecessary visual elements such as extra grid lines, borders and graphics.
