## When to use them
Line charts are best at communicating trends over time rather than the value of distinct data points. 

## The basics
- Use contrasting colors to help people tell lines apart.
- Symbols can help identify breaks in your data, but shouldn't clutter or obscure lines.
- Label each line directly if possible.  
- Start the numeric axis at zero where possible.
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language.

## The basics
- Never use a line chart to compare non-numeric variables, such as country of birth or state of residence. To compare data in categories, use a [bar chart]().
- Use contrasting colors to help people tell lines apart.
- Symbols can help identify breaks in your data, but shouldn't clutter or obscure lines.  
- Use circles or dots on the line at each data point if the lengths of time between them is different.
- Label each line directly if possible.  
- Start the numeric axis at zero where possible.
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language. 
- A continuous line calls attention to overall trends rather than individual data points. Never use a line chart to compare non-numeric variables, such as country of birth. To compare data in separate categories, use a [bar chart]().
- Some changes over time are small but important. To make them easier to see, you can: 
  - Create a focused chart that start the y-axis at a non-zero value. Be sure to show a clear break between zero and the first number. 
  - Place the focused chart next to a primary chart showing the trend in its full context.
- Comparing trends is easier when lines are not layered on top of each other. You can:
  - Give each line its own small chart if there are more than five lines.
  - Combine a line and a bar chart into a composite chart as long as both use the same units of time. See [composite charts]() for examples. 

## Things to avoid
- Placing labels far away from their respective lines
- Unnecessary visual elements such as extra grid lines, chart borders and background graphics
- Curving lines between data points
- Using different thicknesses or patterns to differentiate lines
