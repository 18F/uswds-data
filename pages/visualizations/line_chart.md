## When to use it
Line charts are best at communicating trends over time rather than the value of distinct data points. Never use a line chart to compare non-numeric variables, such as country of birth or state of residence. To compare data in categories, use a [bar chart](linked).

Your raw data might look like this:

## The basics
- Use contrasting colors to make identifying lines from one another easy. 
- Symbols can help identify breaks in your data, but shouldn't clutter or obscure lines. 
- Label each line directly if possible.  
- Start the numeric axis at zero where possible. 
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language. 

## Examples
A continuous line calls attention to overall trends rather than individual data points. Never use a line chart to compare non-numeric variables, such as country of birth. To compare data in separate categories, use a [bar chart](linked).

Your raw data might look something like this:
Some changes over time are small but important. To make them easier to see, add a second, more focused chart, next to a primary chart showing the trend in its full context.

To highlight small changes over time, in some cases you may decide to start the y-axis at a non-zero value.  Just make sure to clearly indicate a clear break between zero and the first number. 

Put circles or dots on the line at each data point when the lengths of time between each data point is not the same.

Comparing trends is easier when lines are not layered on top of each other. Give each line its own small chart if there are more than five lines.

You can create a single chart with both a line and a bar chart as long as both use the same units of time.

## Things to avoid

- Placing labels too far away from their respective lines.
- Unnecessary visual elements such as extra grid lines, borders and graphics.
- Avoid curving lines between data measurements. 
- Avoid using line thickness, or dotted or dashed lines to identify one line from another.
