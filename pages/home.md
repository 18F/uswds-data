# Census Data Design Guidelines

This handy guide is designed to help communicate the wide variety of data and information generated every day by the U.S. Census Bureau into easy-to-understand, visual references for a general audience.  The guide starts by identifying some common guidelines and principles to keep in mind when designing data visualizations using U.S. Census data, and further examines some common types.  We focus first on the most common data visualizations first, with the idea that this guide can be easily expanded once a clear foundation is established.  

Furthermore, we encourage those in the broader community to also contribute ideas and helpful information here.  By making government data more accessible and intuitive for a broader cross-section of the American public, we hope to further expand discussion around topics important to the American people, and illuminated through real, tangible data.  

Moving from basic principles to best practices, this brief guide to visualizing United States Census data introduces the art and and science of drawing clear explanations from complex data.
