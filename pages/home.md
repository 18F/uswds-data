The wide variety of data and information generated every day by the United States Census Bureau is critical to public education, debate, and decision-making. Done well, data visualizations help people more precisely understand the issues that matter to them. They are not only informative but also beautiful. Done poorly, data visualizations misrepresent research findings and lead people to incorrect conclusions.

Moving from basic principles to best practices, this brief guide to visualizing data condenses a wealth of deep technical guidance into easy-to-understand, illustrated references for a general audience. We welcome contributions and feedback on how to update and expand it in the future.
