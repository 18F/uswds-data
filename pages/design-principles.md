lead: With so many types of data visualizations, we focus first on basic principles. These universal guidelines will help  people get the most benefit from your charts, graphs, and data visualizations.

## The goals of plain language also apply to data visualizations
Let your data do the work for you. Lower the cognitive load by removing unnecessary visual components. Get rid of what isn't essential. Drop shadows, boxes around visualizations or their components, and three-dimensional rendering are rarely necessary. Narrow your eyes and squint at your visualization. Can you draw a conclusion from the arrangement of elements? If not, try removing any elements getting in the way.

Label and annotate elements succinctly. Use [plain language](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/). It is your job to describe your data correctly, not a reader's job to guess what you mean.  Avoid the use of abbreviations or shorthand where possible.  If you can't avoid abbreviations, use common ones. For example, write "yrs" for "years."

Be careful with color. Gradients in a bar chart can lead to the wrong interpretation.

The x- and y-axes of a graph need special attention. Don't make readers guess what they mean or lead readers to false conclusions. Start axes at an appropriate value, usually zero. Don't trim the range of values to make insignificant changes look artificially important... unless those small changes are in fact meaningful. In that case, always make it obvious to a viewer that the axis does not start at zero. 

## Mobile first
And by extension, website first.  To communicate with the widest audience, start with the channels that reach the most people.In a world in which more and more people use government services on mobile devices, designing for print introduces distracting complexities. Design with a small screen in mind.

## Choose the right visualization type
People should be able to interpret the data correctly with a minimal amount of supporting information.  Selecting the right chart helps. Ask a non-expert to look at your visualization and tell you what it means. If you have to wait a long time for an answer, or the non-expert can't correctly interpret the data without your help, the visualization isn't effective. Try presenting the data another way.

## Establish and follow a style guide
If you donâ€™t have one yet, use the US Web Design Standards. Use consistent, legible typography, elements, and colors.  Keep any icons consistent. For example, a zoom button on a map should always look the same.

## Provide the data
Make it easy for people to check and extend your work. Link directly to the dataset used to create the graph. Ideally link to machine-readable source data. Avoid sharing data with PDFs. PDFs make it harder for people to extract data. They are also less accessible to screen readers. If the dataset is not public and a subset of the data can not be released, clearly cite the source of the information.    

## Be a trusted source
Let the data tell the story...but only the one it can support. Avoid inconsistent colors, incorrect axes, ambiguous or confusing titles, suggestive visual correlations or other manipulations that your data does not support. Doing so will alienate attentive readers, and lead to broader distrust of government data sources.
