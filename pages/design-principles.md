## The goals of plain language also apply to data visualizations.
Let your data do the work for you. Lower the cognitive load by removing unnecessary visual components. If it isn’t essential, get rid of it. Drop shadows, boxes around visualizations or their components, and three-dimensional rendering are rarely necessary. Close your eyes and squint at your visualization. Can you see the main point? A simple visual scan should be sufficient for many data visualizations.

Label and annotate elements simply and succintly. Use [plain language](http://www.plainlanguage.gov/). It is your job to describe your data correctly, not the reader's job to guess what you mean.  Avoid the use of abbreviations where possible.  If you can't, use common abbreviations (YRS for YEARS).

X and Y axis should be clearly labeled. You don't want your reader guessing at what these mean. Avoid use of unclear abbreviations or shorthand. Start X and Y axis at appropriate places for your dataset. Don't "top" your chart to try and show insignificant changes in values as more significant, unless you clearly indicate you are doing so.

## Mobile first.
And by extension, website first.  To communicate with the widest audience, start with the channels that reach the most people.In a world in which more and more people use government services via mobile devices, designing for print introduces distracting complexities. Design with a small screen in mind.

## Select an appropriate visualization type.
People should be able to interpret the data correctly with a minimal amount of supporting information.  Selecting the right chart will help.  To test whether you’ve to interpret your visualization without an explanation. If a reader has to take an inordinate amount of time to interpret the data, or cannot correctly interpret the data without help, the visualization isn't effective.

## Establish and follow a style guide.
If you don’t have one yet, use the US Web Design Standards. Keep the use of styles, typography and colors uniform.  Use standard, legible typography, elements, and colors.  If iconography is used, keep it uniform (a zoom button on a map - for example, should always look the same).  Be careful when using color - gradients in a bar chart can lead to the wrong interpretation.

## Cite the data.
Citations are important. Your results should be easily verifiable - if the dataset is not public and a subset of the data can not be released, clearly cite the source of the information.  Otherwise, link out to the original dataset used to create the graph, to machine-readable source data where possible.  Make it easy for others to duplicate your visualization.  Avoid using PDFs as a way to distribute data.  PDFs are generally a very inefficient way of sharing data and add burden on the reader.

## Be a trusted source.
Let the data tell the story - but only the one it can support.  Avoid misleading your reader by using inconsistent colors, incorrect axis, misleading titles, suggestive correlations or other manipulations that aren’t substantiated by the data.  Doing so will alienate attentive readers, and lead to broader distrust of government data sources.
