## Place bars on one line 
Bar charts should use a “shared horizon”. 

Start data that are likely to be compared from the same point on a chart. This is often called a “shared horizon.” In a horizontal bar chart, the shared horizon is on the x-axis. On a vertical chart, the shared horizon is usually on the y-axis. To compare values, sit bars next to each other. Don’t stack them on top of each other. Only the bottom bars are easily compared in stacked bar charts. 
Do: Place bars on the same line	Don’t: Stack bars on top of each other
   

## Most of the time, start comparisons at zero 
Bar chart values usually start at zero [1,5]. Starting from zero makes it easier to see how the lengths of the bars relate to different numerical values. It reduces the chance of misleading people. Non-zero starting points can make small differences seem larger than they really are [1]. If small differences are genuinely important to understanding your topic, you can start labelling the value axis at a number other than zero. Just leave enough space between the non-zero starting point and the other axis to tell the user that something unusual.  

### Do: 

Here, a space between the x-axis line and the bottom of the bars tells viewers that the first value is larger than zero. 
Don’t: Start the bars at a non-zero value without any indication

Use horizontal bar charts for ranking
Order items by value unless there is a natural order to the data
Do: Order items by value unless there is a natural order to the data



To highlight the highest values, the longest bar should be at the top of the chart. 



To highlight the lowest values, the shortest bar should be at the top of the chart.



Charts illustrating  “the top 10” or first, second, and third place should follow descending order.

### Don’t:

The purpose of a ranked chart is to make the highest or lowest value very easy to see. Putting items in alphabetical order can make it hard to decide which items have the highest or lowest values. People end to spend more time thinking about interpreting your chart. 

#### Make sure labels are readable
It’s important that labels clearly describe what each bar shows. Long labels often don’t fit well under vertical bars. 

### Don’t: Shorten the labels on a vertical bar chart

### Do: Use horizontal bar charts for long labels 

Distribution
To show:
frequency
distribution
profile
range
concentration
normal curve
population pyramid
shape

### For one variable
Use a histogram to show a distribution of data. Use small gaps between the bars to emphasise the profile of the data.


### For two variables
Use a population pyramid to show the distribution of comparable data sets and highlight differences in the profile of the data.


### For more than two variables
To compare four variables population pyramids can be overlaid, with the least important data set displayed using an outline pyramid instead of bars.

Small multiple charts can also be used for multiple distributions. Use the same scale to enable comparison across charts.


Box-plots can also be used to compare distributions with two or more variables.

## Color
Use one color for all bars, unless the chart is visualizing groups
