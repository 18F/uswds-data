# Bar charts

## What
[Brief description] Bar charts use columns to show relationships among different categories of data. The columns can be arranged either along the [horizontal](anchor link to horizontal subsection) or [vertical](link to subsection) axis. Sorting the bar chart from higher to lower (or lower to higher) values can help people see those relationships more easily.

Bar charts can show time series data only if the data points are all at equal intervals. If the time periods between data measurements are not identical, use a [line chart](link).

## Why
Use bar charts to compare values in distinct groups [2, 8].

Your raw data might look something like this:

| State                                                  | Unemployment rate in 1980 | Unemployment rate in 1990    |
|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| Number of Employees                                    |                           |                              |
| Revenue (Total $'s)                                    |                           |                              |
| Percent (%) of Revenue from SBIR's (from all agencies) |                           |                              |

 
## The basics
- Maintain space between bars so theyâ€™re easy to distinguish. 
- Sort bars based on the data values being represented.
- Use a single color to represent all data representing the same measurement. 
- Start numeric axis at zero where possible. 
- Include a title, source, and labels written in plain language. 
- Maintain consistency and dimensions in look and feel when representing multiple, similar bar charts on a page. 
- Avoid visual elements like bar outlines, extra grid lines, borders and graphics. 

Examples

To highlight the lowest values, the shortest bar should be at the top of the chart.

A bar chart showing a negative value.


## Things to avoid
- Too many bars on the same chart. 
- Alphabetical sorting of values. 
- Representing the same measurement with different colors, or gradients.
- Starting a numeric axis at anything but zero in an attempt to highlight the difference in values. 
- Not including enough information
