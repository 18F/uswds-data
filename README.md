This is a data visualization guide for the [U.S. Web Design Standards][].

## Quick start

To get started, you'll need:

* node 6
* ruby 2.2

To get started, run the following:

```
bash update.sh
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000.

## Using Docker (optional)

Alternatively, you can use [Docker][], which doesn't involve installing
any extra dependencies.

If you are on Windows, you will also need `bash`, which you can probably
get most easily by installing [git for Windows][].

To get started, run:

```
bash docker-update.sh
docker-compose up
```

Then visit http://localhost:4000.
